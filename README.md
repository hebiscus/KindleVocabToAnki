# Kindle Vocab To Anki
This app allows you to turn your Kindle english vocabulary (word you highlighted) along with definitions and context for each word and turn it into a .csv file, which can be then used for Anki flashcards!
<b>Important note - during development. Current state allows you to retrieve a needed file, but quality of definitions is not that good yet.</b>
## Built with:
Typescript, React, Django, Tailwind
